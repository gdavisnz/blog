I found this exam quite challenging. For background, I have been in IT for 20 years, and my experience has mainly been in the infrastructure space. So, even though I’m comfortable with foundational computing concepts like DNS, Networking, Virtual Machines, etc., AWS was new-ish to me when I started this exam journey.\nThe beauty of learning AWS versus on-premises technologies is that a lab is just a few clicks away, where you can spin up various AWS services (some are free in the AWS Free tier, but some come with a cost) and play around with them, as opposed to paying for a home lab for VMware and ESXi.\nStudying Approach I first went through the Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03 on Udemy by Stephane Maarek course. This is a video instructor-led course that covers all AWS services in the exam, with a general introduction to the Public Cloud. I didn’t take many notes during this course but made sure I completed all Hands-On Labs that didn’t incur a cost.\nThe course took me about 3 weeks to complete.\nAfter the course, I went through the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams SAA-C03 2023 by Tutorials Dojo. These practice exams came in various formats. Some were timed like the real exam, some allowed you to review your answers straight away once you answered a question, and some were bundled to be specific about a topic.\nI completed all the topic-specific exams using their attached cheat sheets. When I got questions wrong, this helped me study a specific AWS service. Then I completed all the exams where I could review my answers straight away. These were great because they provided a very good summary afterward. Not only did they give the correct answer with a thorough explanation, but they also went through every wrong answer with an explanation of why it was wrong.\nI then did Practice Exams | AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate by Stephane Maarek \u0026 Abhishek Singh. These were 6 exams with 65 questions each. I treated these like the real exams and revisited topics when I identified any areas I was struggling with.\nNext, I reviewed all FAQs and tried to retain as much knowledge as possible. In most practice exams, I was scoring between 60% and 70%. I wasn’t exactly sure if I was ready for the actual exam. To be honest, I took it because I was getting frustrated and thought I wasn’t retaining any more information. But I passed with a score of 790!\nWhats Next Projects: I am going to get more hands-on experience with AWS, which is part of the reason for this blog. I have scoured the internet and have a list of things I want to do so I can gain practical experience and a better understanding of AWS.\nDeveloper Associate: I’ve been told that if you pass one Associate Exam, you are 50% there for the next one, so hopefully, the developer associate complements the skills I’ve already gained.\nLinks and Materials Used Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03 on Udemy by Stephane Maarek\nPractice Exams | AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate by Stephane Maarek \u0026 Abhishek Singh\nAWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams SAA-C03 2023 by Tutorials Dojo\nFree Resources: Tutorials dojo cheat sheets\nAWS Documentation: Amazon EC2 FAQs\nAmazon S3 FAQs\nAmazon VPC FAQs\nAmazon Route 53 FAQs\nAmazon RDS FAQs\nAmazon SQS FAQs\nAWS Well-Architected and the Six Pillars Whitepapers\nExam Prep Official Practice Question Set: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03 - English)\n","wordCount":"620","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/saa-c03-cover.png","datePublished":"2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Grant Davis"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/posts/saa-c03/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Grant Davis","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/ accesskey=h title="Grant Davis (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gdavisnz.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Grant Davis</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>My Journey towards the SAA-C03 AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-10-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;620 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Grant Davis</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy srcset="https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/posts/saa-c03/saa-c03-cover_hu50dd263e322dd70abca1723c463acecc_25345_360x0_resize_box_3.png 360w ,https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/posts/saa-c03/saa-c03-cover_hu50dd263e322dd70abca1723c463acecc_25345_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w ,https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/posts/saa-c03/saa-c03-cover.png 600w" sizes="(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw" src=https://gdavisnz.github.io/blog/posts/saa-c03/saa-c03-cover.png alt="My Journey towards the SAA-C03 AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification" width=600 height=178></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#studying-approach>Studying Approach</a><ul><li><a href=#whats-next>Whats Next</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#links-and-materials-used>Links and Materials Used</a></li><li><a href=#free-resources>Free Resources:</a><ul><li><a href=#aws-documentation>AWS Documentation:</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>I&rsquo;m a <strong>AWS Solutions Architect Associate!</strong></p><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>Below is some of the study material I used to pass the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification (SAA-C03) Exam.
